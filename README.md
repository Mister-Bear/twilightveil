# 🧛‍♂️ Twilight Veil: NYC — A Custom World of Darkness MUSH Built in Evennia

**Welcome to the development portal for Twilight Veil: NYC**, a Python-powered MUSH set in the World of Darkness universe. This project is not just a server—it's a living, breathing narrative engine combining immersive roleplay mechanics, rich lore, and modular game systems.

This repository reflects my personal journey as a curriculum strategist, educator, and self-taught Python developer. Every line of code in this MUSH is a love letter to storytelling, player agency, and scalable system design.
